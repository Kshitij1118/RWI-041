aggregation:

If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation. Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship.
Consider a situation, Employee object contains many informations such as id, name, emailId etc. It contains one more object named address, which contains its own informations such as city, state, country, zipcode etc.


Aggregation.java

public class Main
{
    int id;
    String name;
    Address address;
    
    public Main(int id, String name,Address address){
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }
    
    void display(){
        System.out.println(id+""+name);
        System.out.println(address.city+""+address.state+""+address.country);
    }
    
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Address address1=new Address("Dwarka sec 12","Delhi", "india");
        Address address2=new Address("Dwarka Mor","Delhi", "india");
        
        
        Main i=new Main(31,"Kshitij", "india");
        Main i2=new Main(85,"ankit", "india");
        
        i.display();
        i2.display();
        
    }
}



Address.java

public class Address {  
String city,state,country;  
  
public Address(String city, String state, String country) {  
    this.city = city;  
    this.state = state;  
    this.country = country;  
}  
  
} 


Sir Example:

package com.practise;
class Student {
	private int sid;
	private String sname;
	public Student(int sid, String sname) {
		super();
		this.sid = sid;
		this.sname = sname;
	}
	public int getSid() {
		return sid;
	}
	public void setSid(int sid) {
		this.sid = sid;
	}
	public String getSname() {
		return sname;
	}
	public void setSname(String sname) {
		this.sname = sname;
	}	
}
class Department{
	private String dname;
	 private Student student;
	public Department(String dname, Student student) {
		super();
		this.dname = dname;
		this.student = student;
	}
	 
	 void show()
	 {
		 System.out.println("Department Name  ="+ dname +" \n" + "Student ="+student.getSid()+" "+ student.getSname());
	 }
	 
}
public class Aggregation {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Student s1=new Student(121, "Sneha");
		Student s2=new Student(122, "Sakshi");
		
		Department d=new Department("Computer Science", s1);
		Department d1=new Department("polytechnic", s2);
		d.show();
		d1.show();
		
		
		

	}

}
