Method Overriding in Java:
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.

Usage of Java Method Overriding:
Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.
Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism


Rules for Java Method Overriding:
The method must have the same name as in the parent class
The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).


//Java Program to demonstrate why we need method overriding  
//Here, we are calling the method of parent class with child  
//class object.  
//Creating a parent class  
class Vehicle{  
  void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running");}  
}  
//Creating a child class  
class Bike extends Vehicle{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  //creating an instance of child class  
  Bike obj = new Bike();  
  //calling the method with child class instance  
  obj.run();  
  }  
}  

Output:
Vehicle is running


Example of method overriding:
//Java Program to demonstrate the real scenario of Java Method Overriding  
//where three classes are overriding the method of a parent class.  
//Creating a parent class.  
class Bank{  
int getRateOfInterest(){return 0;}  
}  
//Creating child classes.  
class SBI extends Bank{  
int getRateOfInterest(){return 8;}  
}  
  
class ICICI extends Bank{  
int getRateOfInterest(){return 7;}  
}  
class AXIS extends Bank{  
int getRateOfInterest(){return 9;}  
}  
//Test class to create objects and call the methods  
class Test2{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
SBI s=new SBI();  
ICICI i=new ICICI();  
AXIS a=new AXIS();  
System.out.println("SBI Rate of Interest: "+s.getRateOfInterest());  
System.out.println("ICICI Rate of Interest: "+i.getRateOfInterest());  
System.out.println("AXIS Rate of Interest: "+a.getRateOfInterest());  
}  
}

Output:
SBI Rate of Interest: 8
ICICI Rate of Interest: 7
AXIS Rate of Interest: 9
